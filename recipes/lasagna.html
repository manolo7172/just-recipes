    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>While you're making your beef and ricotta mixtures, your lasagna noodles will typically be hanging out in a colander, getting stuck together (worst nightmare). To prevent this, after you drain the noodles from the pasta pot, slick them with olive oil and lay them flat on a baking sheet to cool.</p>
    <p>We decided to go with store-bought marinara for this recipe but it doesn't mean you should pick any old jar off the shelf. Even though there are tons of layers and flavors in lasagna, the marinara is the back bone of the dish. Spending a couple more bucks on your favorite brand is worth it in this case.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 lb. lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>2 lb. ground beef</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375ยบ. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through.</li>
        <li>Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400ยบ and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
